    the rootfs. Also added error handling code for when install.cfg is
    not found -- install.sh will break without it.

  * Turned on Hyperthreading for UME kernel with kernel cmd-line option

  * The nolapic fix breaks USB and Hyperthreading. The nolapic kernel cmd-line
    option was added, now removed, to fix an issue with too many extra timer
    interrupts which in effects prevents the CPU from going into a lower C
    state.

  * kernel command-line options in the default config file were all messed
    up. For example the option nolapic_timer was being applied to all
    platforms when it's only needed for menlow.

  * Really change over to using /proc/mounts instead of /etc/mtab.  Forget to
    actually commit the file last time.
  * Adding in our config file processing stuff
  * Adding in our default config file
  * Deleting library that wasn't needed.  Also deleted some extraneous
    functions.
  * fixing up mic_cfg.py.  Just some cleanup.
  * Putting new config system in place.  Fingers are crossed.
  * Removing very very verbose messages on error.
  * Give a warning if people are using the old ~/.image-creator/platforms.cfg
    file.
  * Decided to use [platform] rather than [bootstrap] seemed more appropriate
    as I added a few more options.
  * Added an [installimage] section to the config
  * Make our umount function use the pdk_utils.getMountInfo() function.  This
    function uses /proc/mounts to determine the mounts on the system.
    Hopefully this will do a better job in umounting stuff
  * Fix issue with misspelled variable
  * Convert fset names on the command line to lowercase.
  * Fix indenation error that was causing our retries to fail
  * Previous fix uncovered a bug in resetting an environement error.  Fixing
    that.
  * Update so that both platforms are using galculator.
  * Added a debug option to the config file, well make more extensive use of
    it in the future.
  * More debug option work.
  * Bob likes to use symbolic links, this seems to cause issues.  So putting
    in an attempted fix for that.
  * More fixing for symbolic links
  * Add a "progress bar" when writing an image to a USB drive.
  * Removed ISO buttons.  Also cleaned up the UI a little bit.  Hopefully text
    will not be cut-off on the buttons anymore.
  * Fix the pixmap to be MIC rather than PB.
  * We now umount all of our mounts upon quitting.
  * Minor changes to GUI layout
  * Add the README to the documentation in the debian package
  * Created an SDK umount() function which takes care of umounting all the
    projects that the SDK knows about.  Now call this function from the GUI,
    rather than having the GUI iterate through the projects and umounting
    them.
  * Make the command line version also umount all of our mounts upon exit.
  * Create the (chroot)/etc/debian_chroot file when doing a chroot from the
    GUI.  So you can more easily tell which terminal is a chroot.
  * Clean up the command line completion code.  Added --run-command and
    deleted the ones relating to ISO creation, since we don't do that.
  * Edited the options that image-creator accepts.  Deleted the ISO ones.
    Also made it so that commands can be easily sorted in the text editor.
  * Fix error from previous commit.  Also starting work on save and load
    project feature
  * Make sure the callback feature gets called for progress indication
  * Work in progress on adding a save-project command.  Basic functionality
    works from the image-creator command line.
  * Improving the execCommand() function so that it won't block and then cause
    our throbber to stop.  Also improved some of the exception printing.
  * Changing the code in relation to the callback for the progress/throbber
    bar.  Just making it simpler.
  * Who knew that writing an execCommand() function would be so complicated :(
    Work continues.
  * Try to minimize the time that the throbber stops during image creation.
  * Add a little more documentation to the config file.
  * Added a generated [userinfo] section to the config information.  It is NOT
    in any of the config files but is generated by mic_cfg.py.  Purpose of
    this is so that we have away of knowing what user we really are even if we
    do a sudo.

    problem with the last version of this fix was that the update was performed

  * Putting in the creation of (chroot_dir)/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d which will
    exit with value 101.  This disables packages from running postinstall
    scripts, I believe.
  * Run our chroot command so that stdin is closed.  This will make sure that
    we don't hang, waiting for some process that is asking for input.
  * Increment the try count and output some descriptive messages for the
    rootstrap creation process.
  * Try to clean up the update and install functions.  Have a single variable
    that contains the big honkin' command line we use.  Also do some pausing
