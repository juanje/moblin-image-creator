  [ Alek Du ]
  * Add vfat partition support, this includes:1. make mic config file installimage section support
    platform aspect. 2. add vfat options 3. change install.sh to support vfat partition creation
    4. add dosfstool to core fset
  * Add psmisc package to fset core (need fuser utils inside for USBC framework)
  * Remove fat32 partition mount point config, since it will be decided by crown-beach-config

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Added a [distribution.*] section to the config file.  The required_exe
    list is now in there.  The config file will now contain a

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Work continues on getting to being able to NOT using squashfs.  Cleaned up
    the platform/*/install.sh files.
  * Created a "generic" platform directory that files common to all platforms
    will be placed.  Updated the makefiles to use this directory.
  * Decided to rename "generic" to a more descriptive (IMHO) "common"
    directory.
  * More work on putting stuff into the "common" platform directory.
  * Fix makefile targets for new "common" platform directory.
  * Support for installing without squashfs
  * Fixed issue with config info for use_squashfs not getting into the config
    file.
  * Cleaning up config file creation so that we write all the same config
    values to both of our config files in the install process.
  * Trying to debug failure to mount
  * Fix bug in initramfs/disk script
  * Cleaning up debug code.
  * Made mksquashfs NOT display progress.
  * Make our filesystems get mounted using the 'noatime' and 'nodiratime'
    mount options.  Hopefully this will help performance a little bit.
  * Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/moblin-image-creator/+bug/159298, "Wrong
    package version installed in target".  I am hopeful that this will fix the
    bug.

  * Adding status label to progress bar to indicate current action

  [ Rob Rhoads ]
  * Added a work around for Q1U where the local APIC timer stops working
    after a resume from a S4 (Hibernate). The work around is to add the
    kernel cmd-line option "nolapic_timer" to the mccaslin-lpia hd boot.

  [ Rob Rhoads ]
  * Fixed JohnV's bug with the new install.cfg file. It now is copied to
    the rootfs. Also added error handling code for when install.cfg is
    not found -- install.sh will break without it.

  * Turned on Hyperthreading for UME kernel with kernel cmd-line option

  * The nolapic fix breaks USB and Hyperthreading. The nolapic kernel cmd-line
    option was added, now removed, to fix an issue with too many extra timer
    interrupts which in effects prevents the CPU from going into a lower C
    state.

  * kernel command-line options in the default config file were all messed
    up. For example the option nolapic_timer was being applied to all
    platforms when it's only needed for menlow.

    adding my own list of deverloper packages.  (Includes hildon-dev pkgs)

  [ John L. Villalovos ]

    2. swap and default enabled
  * Dynamically creating /etc/fstab

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Some minor cleanup of the swap enabling code.
  * Cleaning up code and adding comments, all in the hopes of making the code

    process.
  * Now creating a config file that is used during the initramfs boot process.
  * Added a few more status messages because I was trying to better understand
    the image creation process.

  * Create a sample ~/.image-creator/sources_cfg file if none exists.

  [ Rusty Lynch ]
  * Fixed a bug where image creation was running depmod in the project
    filesystem instead of the target filesystem.  A recent bug in the
    linux-ubuntu-modules package (where depmod is not being correctly
    called in the postinst) exposed this bug which ultimatly results
    in unbootable images.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Use the linux-lpiacompat kernel for the McCaslin kernel
  * Disable the internationalization init stuff, since we are not using
    internationalization at the moment.
  * Updated the README file with information on how to speedup image-creator
    using a local mirror of Ubuntu
  * Remove the -q/quiet option since we aren't honoring it.  Maybe in the
    future we can bring it back.
  * moblin-media is the new name for mobile-player, updated the FSETs
    accordingly.
  * Added a config file option to control the verbosity of the tar command
    during save/load projects.  The default verbosity is silent.

  [ prajwal ]

  * Really change over to using /proc/mounts instead of /etc/mtab.  Forget to
    actually commit the file last time.
  * Adding in our config file processing stuff
  * Adding in our default config file
  * Deleting library that wasn't needed.  Also deleted some extraneous
    functions.
  * fixing up mic_cfg.py.  Just some cleanup.
  * Putting new config system in place.  Fingers are crossed.
  * Removing very very verbose messages on error.
  * Give a warning if people are using the old ~/.image-creator/platforms.cfg
    file.
  * Decided to use [platform] rather than [bootstrap] seemed more appropriate
    as I added a few more options.
  * Added an [installimage] section to the config
  * Make our umount function use the pdk_utils.getMountInfo() function.  This
    function uses /proc/mounts to determine the mounts on the system.
    Hopefully this will do a better job in umounting stuff
  * Fix issue with misspelled variable
  * Convert fset names on the command line to lowercase.
  * Fix indenation error that was causing our retries to fail
  * Previous fix uncovered a bug in resetting an environement error.  Fixing
    that.
  * Update so that both platforms are using galculator.
  * Added a debug option to the config file, well make more extensive use of
    it in the future.
  * More debug option work.
  * Bob likes to use symbolic links, this seems to cause issues.  So putting
    in an attempted fix for that.
  * More fixing for symbolic links
  * Add a "progress bar" when writing an image to a USB drive.
  * Removed ISO buttons.  Also cleaned up the UI a little bit.  Hopefully text
    will not be cut-off on the buttons anymore.
  * Fix the pixmap to be MIC rather than PB.
  * We now umount all of our mounts upon quitting.
  * Minor changes to GUI layout
  * Add the README to the documentation in the debian package
  * Created an SDK umount() function which takes care of umounting all the
    projects that the SDK knows about.  Now call this function from the GUI,
    rather than having the GUI iterate through the projects and umounting
    them.
  * Make the command line version also umount all of our mounts upon exit.
  * Create the (chroot)/etc/debian_chroot file when doing a chroot from the
    GUI.  So you can more easily tell which terminal is a chroot.
  * Clean up the command line completion code.  Added --run-command and
    deleted the ones relating to ISO creation, since we don't do that.
  * Edited the options that image-creator accepts.  Deleted the ISO ones.
    Also made it so that commands can be easily sorted in the text editor.
  * Fix error from previous commit.  Also starting work on save and load
    project feature
  * Make sure the callback feature gets called for progress indication
  * Work in progress on adding a save-project command.  Basic functionality
    works from the image-creator command line.
  * Improving the execCommand() function so that it won't block and then cause
    our throbber to stop.  Also improved some of the exception printing.
  * Changing the code in relation to the callback for the progress/throbber
    bar.  Just making it simpler.
  * Who knew that writing an execCommand() function would be so complicated :(
    Work continues.
  * Try to minimize the time that the throbber stops during image creation.
  * Add a little more documentation to the config file.
  * Added a generated [userinfo] section to the config information.  It is NOT
    in any of the config files but is generated by mic_cfg.py.  Purpose of
    this is so that we have away of knowing what user we really are even if we
    do a sudo.
  * Added the load-project functionality to the command line

    problem with the last version of this fix was that the update was performed

  * Putting in the creation of (chroot_dir)/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d which will
    exit with value 101.  This disables packages from running postinstall
    scripts, I believe.
  * Run our chroot command so that stdin is closed.  This will make sure that
    we don't hang, waiting for some process that is asking for input.
  * Increment the try count and output some descriptive messages for the
    rootstrap creation process.
  * Try to clean up the update and install functions.  Have a single variable
    that contains the big honkin' command line we use.  Also do some pausing

  * Initrd images are now generated for each installed kernel in a target image.
    This should fixes a bug where the initrd's didn't match the system nor
    entries in grub's menu.lst file which were generated by update-grub.

  * Fixing debian changelog to account for the following changes from Alek Du...
  * Needn't to keep target's /usr/share/pdk mount, since mksquashfs runs in
    project's jail root not target's
  * Keep /usr/share/pdk mounted while making squashfs, because mksquashfs needs
    the initramfs dir in /usr/share/pdk/platform/ ...
  * For menlow platform, our kernel-mid does not use libata yet. so the PATA
    dev nodes still are hda1 hda2, etc. So I have to modify disk scripts in this ugl
  * umount target fs's /proc & /sys file system before making squashfs, otherwize
    mksquash will encounter errors, since there are now not bind mounted. :-(
  * Add update-grub to image creator to generate menu.lst on the fly.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Allow the use of a ~/.image-creator/platforms.cfg file to set the
    buildroot_mirror, target_mirror.

    interesting ways in some chroots.

    McCaslin.

  [ Rusty Lynch ]

    to 10 times, with a 'apt-get update' between each attempt.  This
    should resolve bug #2

  [ John L. Villalovos ]

  * Updating the menlow usb and disk initramfs scripts
  * Adding new --bypass-rootstrap command line argument to allow
    for the creation of project and target filesystems without
    using a cached rootstrap archive.
  * Adding new --clear-rootstraps command line argument to allow
    users to clear out rootstrap files
  * Adding multiverse apt config files for mccaslin
  * Adding a feature where a failed debootstrap call will be retried
    for up to 10 ten times before giving up.  This helps get past
    spurious network issues that debootstrap will call a corrupt apt
    repository.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]

  [ Rusty Lynch ]
  * Changed the entry level script from 'project-builder
    to 'image-creator', and fixed a few random locations that
    were still using the old name.
  * Reworked the usb installation script, and the usb and disk initramfs
    scripts to work correctly with the ubuntu kernel now that the HD shows
    up as /dev/sda.  Also performed some cleanup in the early boot process.
  * Cleaning up the mccaslin base fset by removing references to the
    zi9, making the core fset use the ubuntu 386 kernel and removing the
    previous 'ubuntu-flavored-core'
  * Removing local apt repository code from both menlow and mccaslin
    platforms since it has proved itself to not be needed and as a
    result was just complicating the build process
  * Adding 'umount-project' and 'umount-target' command line options
  * Adding 'run-project' and 'run-target' command line options
    that allow for arbitrary execution of commands in either the buildroot
    or target root file-system
  * reworked the pdk_utils.exeCommand command to use the normal stdout/stderr
    when an output array is not passed in.
  * reworked the mccaslin base fset to fit with packaging changes from the
    ubuntu gutsy sprint

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Add a Depends on bzip2.
  * Add restricted to the default list of sources.list.
  * Make the Samsung Q1 image use linux-generic, not linux-image-generic.  This
    should enable more of the hardware.

    exist.
